### **Michelson** {#michelson}

Michelson is the domain-specific language used to write smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain. Michelson is a stack-based language and does not have variables. Stack-oriented languages operate on one or more stacks, each of which may serve a different purpose.

### **High-level Languages of Tezos**

Tezos has several popular high-level languages which offer more approachable syntaxes and familiar developer experience (e.g. local variables) compared to writing Michelson directly. SmartPy and LIGO are the most popular and widely-supported languages for writing Tezos smart contracts.
