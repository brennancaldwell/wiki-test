## **OCaml, the language of the Tezos protocol**

The Tezos protocol is written in OCaml, a general purpose industrial-strength programming language with an emphasis on expressiveness and safety. It is the technology of choice in companies where speed is crucial and a single mistake can cost millions. It has a large standard library, which makes it useful for many of the same applications as Python or Perl, and it has robust modular and object-oriented programming constructs that make it applicable for large-scale software engineering. Many top companies use OCaml, including Facebook, Bloomberg, Docker, and Jane Street.

## **What is functional programming? How is it different from other paradigms?**

[Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so that calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time. This is in contrast to procedures that depend on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e. changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.

Here is a diagram that shows the high-level differences between the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), WASM (Web Assembly) and Michelson:

# Michelson Language {#michelson}

# Introduction

Michelson is the low-level, stack-based programming language used to write smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain. Michelson was designed to facilitate formal verification, allowing users to prove the properties of their contracts.

It uses a stack rewriting paradigm, whereby each function rewrites an input stack into an output stack. (The meaning of this will be fully explained below.) This runs in a purely functional way and does not modify the inputs at all. Thus, all data structures are **immutable**.

# What is a Stack?

A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push (adds an element to the collection) and pop (removes the most recently added element that has not yet been removed). The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.

# Rewriting Stacks

To see what mean it means to rewrite stacks, we will run through a transaction in Michelson. First, before a transaction runs, the blockchain state at a certain hash is deserialized and put onto the stack as the variable `storage`. We have a `from` function that receives the transaction data `amount` , the amount of attached ꜩ, and the `parameter` , the function's parameters.

    from [ (Pair (Pair amount parameter) storage) ]

After running the function, without any updates to the stack, the program will call a `to` function that has the parameters `result`, which is the result of the function, and the output `storage` that is serialized and stored on the blockchain.

    to [ (Pair result storage) ]

In the example, Michelson only manipulates the stack functionally and a new stack is passed from function to function.
