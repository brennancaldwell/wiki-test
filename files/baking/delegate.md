# What is delegating? {#delegate}
If someone does not have 8,000 XTZ or does not want to set up computing infrastructure to bake blocks, they may delegate their coins to a baker (aka "delegate"). Delegating lets coin holders (i.e. "delegators") "lend" their coins to a baker (i.e. a "delegate"), giving the baker a higher probability of being selected to bake and endorse blocks. In practice, bakers usually share the additional revenue generated from the delegated tokens with the coin holder. Importantly, this process does not actually transfer ownership of coins and hence the baker cannot spend or control the XTZ delegated to it, ensuring that bakers cannot appropriate the delegators' funds.
