# What is baking? {#what}
Baking is how blocks are produced and validated on the Tezos blockchain. To bake blocks, you need to take part in [Tezos Proof-of-stake system](proofofstake.md#consensus), which requires a minimum of 8,000 XTZ (1 roll). The more XTZ you own, the higher your chances are at baking blocks and earning baking rewards.
